- description: This section consists of security recommendations for the components
    that run on Kubernetes worker nodes. Note that these components may also run on
    Kubernetes control plane nodes, so the recommendations in this section should
    be applied to control plane nodes as well as worker nodes where the control plane
    nodes make use of these components.

- description: 'Kubernetes Roles and ClusterRoles provide access to resources based
    on sets of objects and actions that can be taken on those objects. It is possible
    to set either of these to be the wildcard "*" which matches all items.


    Use of wildcards is not optimal from a security perspective as it may allow for
    inadvertent access to be granted when new resources are added to the Kubernetes
    API either as CRDs or in later versions of the product.

- description: The ability to create pods in a namespace can provide a number of opportunities
    for privilege escalation, such as assigning privileged service accounts to these
    pods or mounting hostPaths with access to sensitive data (unless Pod Security
    Policies are implemented to restrict this access). As such, access to create new  pods
    should be restricted to the smallest possible group of users.
