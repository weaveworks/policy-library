description: 'The General Data Protection Regulation is a European Union law that
  was implemented May 25, 2018, and requires organizations to safeguard personal data
  and uphold the privacy rights of anyone in EU territory. The regulation includes
  seven principles of data protection that must be implemented and eight privacy rights
  that must be facilitated. It also empowers member state-level data protection authorities
  to enforce the GDPR with sanctions and fines. The GDPR replaced the 1995 Data Protection
  Directive, which created a country-by-country patchwork of data protection laws.
  The GDPR, passed in European Parliament by overwhelming majority, unifies the EU
  under a single data protection regime.
