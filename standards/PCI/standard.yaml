- description: 'Firewalls are devices that control computer traffic allowed between

    an entity''s networks (internal) and untrusted networks (external), as well as

    traffic into and out of more sensitive areas within an entity''s internal trusted

    networks. The cardholder data environment is an example of a more sensitive area

    within an entity''s trusted network. A firewall examines all network traffic and

    blocks those transmissions that do not meet the specified security criteria. All

    systems must be protected from unauthorized access from untrusted networks, whether

    entering the system via the Internet as e-commerce, employee Internet access through

    desktop browsers, employee e-mail access, dedicated connections such as business-to-business

    connections, via wireless networks, or via other sources. Often, seemingly insignificant

    paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into key

    systems. Firewalls are a key protection mechanism for any computer network. Other

    system components may provide firewall functionality, as long as they meet the

    minimum requirements for firewalls as defined in Requirement 1. Where other system

    components are used within the cardholder data environment to provide firewall

    functionality, these devices must be included within the scope and assessment

    of Requirement 1.

    effective methods of protecting stored data should also be considered as potential
    risk mitigation opportunities. For example, methods for minimizing risk include
    not storing cardholder data unless absolutely necessary, truncating cardholder
    data if full PAN is not needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user
