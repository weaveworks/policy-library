    \ delay, omission, and unauthorized or inadvertent manipulation. Because of the\
    \ number of systems used by an entity, processing integrity is usually only addressed\

    \ processing integrity refers to whether processing is complete, valid, accurate,\
    \ timely, and authorized to produce, manufacture, or distribute goods that meet\

    \ access, use, and retention and restrict its disclosure to defined parties (including\
    \ those who may otherwise have authorized access within its system boundaries).\

    \ personal information, whereas confidentiality applies to various types of sensitive\
