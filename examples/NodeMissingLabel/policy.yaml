description: |
  This Policy only looks for specific node label keys.

  Important node labels include:
  ### kubernetes.io/hostname
  The Kubelet populates this label with the hostname. Note that the hostname can be changed from the "actual" hostname by passing the --hostname-override flag to the kubelet.

  ### kubernetes.io/arch
  The Kubelet populates this with runtime.GOARCH as defined by Go. This can be handy if you are mixing arm and x86 nodes.

  ### node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
  The Kubelet populates this with the instance type as defined by the cloudprovider. This will be set only if you are using a cloudprovider. This setting is handy if you want to target certain workloads to certain instance types, but typically you want to rely on the Kubernetes scheduler to perform resource-based scheduling. You should aim to schedule based on properties rather than on instance types (for example: require a GPU, instead of requiring a g2.2xlarge).

  ### kubernetes.io/os
  The Kubelet populates this with runtime.GOOS as defined by Go. This can be handy if you are mixing operating systems in your cluster (for example: mixing Linux and Windows nodes).

  ### topology.kubernetes.io/zone
  The kubelet or the external cloud-controller-manager populates this with the information as provided by the cloudprovider. This will be set only if you are using a cloudprovider. However, you should consider setting this on nodes if it makes sense in your topology.

  Ensure the label is as specified in the Policy.
