    can be embedded directly into the image file system. However, this practice creates
    a security risk because anyone with access to the image can easily parse it to
    learn these secrets.

    Setting them improperly can lower the relative security of the system. For example,

    default to only those required for safe operation of containers. If this list
    is widened, it may expose containers and the host OS to increased risk from a
    compromised container. Similarly, if a container is run in privileged mode, it
    has access to all the devices on the host, thus allowing it to essentially act
    as part of the host OS and impact all other containers running on it.


    Another example of an insecure runtime configuration is allowing containers to
    mount sensitive directories on the host. Containers should rarely make changes
    to the host OS file system and should almost never make changes to locations that
    control the basic functionality of the host OS (e.g., /boot or /etc for Linux
    containers, C:\Windows for Windows containers). If a compromised container is
    allowed to make changes to these paths, it could be used to elevate privileges
    and attack the host itself as well as other containers running on the host.

- description: Traditional approaches for data at rest encryption often involve the
    use of host-based capabilities that may be incompatible with containers. Thus,
    organizations should use tools for encrypting data used with containers that allow
    the data to be accessed properly from containers regardless of the node they are
    running on. Such encryption tools should provide the same barriers to unauthorized
    access and tampering, using the same cryptographic approaches as those defined
    in NIST SP 800-111 [19].

- description: Orchestrators should be configured to separate network traffic into
    discrete virtual networks by sensitivity level. While per-app segmentation is
    also possible, for most organizations and use cases, simply defining networks
    by sensitivity level provides sufficient mitigation of risk with a manageable
    degree of complexity. For example, public-facing apps can share a virtual network,
    internal apps can use another, and communication between the two should occur
    through a small number of well-defined interfaces.

- description: Orchestration platforms should be configured to provide features that
    create a secure environment for all the apps they run. Orchestrators should ensure
    that nodes are securely introduced to the cluster, have a persistent identity
    throughout their lifecycle, and can also provide an accurate inventory of nodes
    and their connectivity states. Organizations should ensure that orchestration
    platforms are designed specifically to be resilient to compromise of individual
    nodes without compromising the overall security of the cluster. A compromised
    node must be able to be isolated and removed from the cluster without disrupting
    or degrading overall cluster operations. Finally, organizations should choose
    orchestrators that provide mutually authenticated network connections between
    cluster members and end-to-end encryption of intra-cluster traffic. Because of
    the portability of containers, many deployments may occur across networks organizations
    do not directly control, so a secure-by-default posture is particularly important
    for this scenario.

    and when problems are detected, they must be remediated quickly. A vulnerable
    runtime exposes all containers it supports, as well as the host itself, to potentially
    significant risk. Organizations should use tools to look for Common Vulnerabilities
    and Exposures (CVEs) vulnerabilities in the runtimes deployed, to upgrade any
    instances at risk, and to ensure that orchestrators only allow deployments to
    properly maintained runtimes.

    \ Organizations can use a variety of tools to \u201Cscan\u201D and assess their\

    This approach isolates writes to specifically defined directories, which can then
    be more easily monitored by the aforementioned tools. Furthermore, using read-only
    filesystems makes the containers more resilient to compromise since any tampering
    is isolated to these specific locations and can be easily separated from the rest
    of the app.

    more minimal to start with since the OSs are specifically designed to host containers
    and have other services and functionality disabled. Further, because these optimized
    OSs are designed specifically for hosting containers, they typically feature read-only
    file systems and employ other hardening practices by default. Whenever possible,
    organizations should use these minimalistic OSs to reduce their attack surfaces
    and mitigate the typical risks and hardening activities associated with general-purpose
    OSs.

    level, organizations should not mix containerized and non-containerized workloads
    on the same host instance. For example, if a host is running a web server container,
    it should not also run a web server (or any other app) as a regularly installed
    component directly within the host OS. Keeping containerized workloads isolated
    to container-specific hosts makes it simpler and safer to apply countermeasures
    and defenses that are optimized for protecting containers.

    manner with a greatly reduced attack surface. Additionally, it provides a more
