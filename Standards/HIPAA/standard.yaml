description: |
    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)\
    is a US federal law that required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive\
    patient health information from being disclosed without the patient\u2019s consent\
    or knowledge.

    The Security Rule defines technical safeguards in ยง 164.304 as "the technology and the policy and procedures for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control access to it." As outlined in previous papers in this series, the Security Rule is based on the fundamental concepts of flexibility, scalability and technology neutrality. Therefore, no specific requirements for types of technology to implement are identified. The Rule allows a covered entity to use any security measures that allows it reasonably and appropriately to implement the standards and implementation specifications. A covered entity must determine which security measures and specific technologies are reasonable and appropriate for implementation in its organization.

    Magalix supports those Technical Safeguards, where applicapble.
