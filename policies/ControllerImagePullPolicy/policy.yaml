  name: Container Image Pull Policy
  description: |
    This Policy is to ensure you are setting a value for your `imagePullPolicy`. 

    The `imagePullPolicy` and the tag of the image affect when the kubelet attempts to pull the specified image.

    `imagePullPolicy`: IfNotPresent: the image is pulled only if it is not already present locally.

    `imagePullPolicy`: Always: every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container.

    `imagePullPolicy` is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or it is omitted: `imagePullPolicy` is automatically set to Always. Note that this will not be updated to IfNotPresent if the tag changes value.

    `imagePullPolicy` is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest: `imagePullPolicy` is automatically set to IfNotPresent. Note that this will not be updated to Always if the tag is later removed or changed to :latest.

    `imagePullPolicy`: Never: the image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image.

    Ensure you have an imagePullPolicy set that matches your policy.
