  name: Containers Using Hostpath
  description: |
    This Policy checks for containers that are trying to use HostPath. 

    A `hostPath` volume mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into your Pod. This is not something that most Pods will need, but it offers a powerful escape hatch for some applications.
  how_to_solve: |
    Using HostPath could allow mounting the entire host’s filesystem into your pod, giving you read/write access on the host’s filesystem. This leaves your cluster vulnerable to escape Kubernetes constraints and access components at the Node (OS) level.
